            <p class="fs-5" style="word-wrap: normal;">
                Medoles (/mɛˈdoʊlz/ MEH-DOHLS), officially the Most Serene Republic of Medoles, is a sovereign nation in North America and an enclave inside Canada which is considered by most to be a micronation. Medoles is a peninsula surrounded by Charleston Lake, at the heart of the Frontenac Axis region. It has a land area of approximately 0.25 square kilometers and a population of 30 as of 2025.
                <br><br>
                Founded on 24 January 2024, Medoles takes its name from Medoles Point, one of the key geographical features of the area. The name might have derived from the word medole, defined as soft and juicy essence of a plant. It likely relates to the soft nature of the soil at Medoles Point. It came into existence through its 3 founders: TheArtistTree, X-Man & Helium.

                Before European settlements, Native American villages occupied the area that is now Medoles, most recently inhabited by the Iroquois, Algonquins and the Mississaugas. Following the arrival of the Europeans, they were involved in the fur trade, especially with the French, who eventually created settlements as early as 1670. Following the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, also known as the French and Indian War in 1763. The area was transferred to Great Britain as part of the province of Quebec, which would eventually become the dominion of Canada. Charleston Lake is part of what used to be Grenville County. It united with Leeds County to form the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, Ontario, in 1850.
                <br><br>
                Discussions for the emergence of a sovereign Medolite state began to take shape in January 2024, with the founding members of TheArtistTree, X-Man and Helium. The following months forged the core identity and building blocks of Medoles, including the governmental structure. In June 2024, they opened their doors to citizenship, hosting their first elections in the same month under the banner of the Most Serene Republic of Medoles. After the electoral structuring of the government, the following months were relatively quiet until December 2024, when they established their first foreign exchanges and initiated the activities of the parliament. In March 2025, a short-lived and failed coup attempted by Steve Zelhas to impose foreign influence on Medoles and put in doubt its autonomy, known as the "Zeion Revolt" or the "2025 March Revolt".

They function as collaborative groups of like-minded individuals who choose to work together towards a shared interest. Each party operates according to the preference set by their respective leader. The first political party, the Conservative Party of Medoles, was founded in June 2024. Despite its short lifespan, it paved the way for future political groups, which emerged in January 2025 onward. As of March 2025, there are currently three active parties.

                Medoles is an enclave surrounded by Canada in North America, within the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville in Ontario, and approximately 14 kilometres from the Saint-Lawrence River. The micronation is located in the Frontenac Axis region, an extension of the Canadian Shield, notable for the exposed Precambrian rocks, allowing distinct fauna and flora to flourish. The area is surrounded by the Charleston Lake in the West, East and North, which acts as a prime fishing zone for Medolites. Outside of the islands populating the lakes like Why Island, Because Island and Lion Island as part of Medoles, the mainland has a few named geographical features: Medoles Point and Buckhorn Point, both named in March 1968.
