                <br><br>
                August is rolling around as Summer is dawning on us. Due to a recently passed bill by Senator Cynthia de Sanguine, the Senate will soon expand to 5 seats. We will see its fullest extent in the coming weeks. For once, we will be keeping the article relatively short. This time around, we will see the six candidates battling out for two of those seats: Xesphor, Maytix, Tom Ombre, Noah, Matpat, and Mymy.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Noah de Sanguine</b><br>    
               The first to rush for a position on the ballot is Noah de Sanguine, also known as incineroar359. They will be running as an independent candidate. When asked about their campaign, they expressed: "I'm Noah, one of Medoles' resident queers and hopefully one of the future senators. If you want the senators of our country to be both reliable and frequently active, look no further. I wish to improve Medoles in anyway I can to make it a better place for every single one of us, but to do that I need your help. Please send any ideas you have into my office (found under the "other" forum) and if it's reasonable and possible I will try my best to make it happen." 
                <br><br>
               <b>2. Tom Ombre</b><br> 
               The next candidate lined up is Tom Ombre. He is the representative of the National Prosperity Party of Medoles (NPPM). In terms of his campaign, he stated:
                
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "In an effort to avoid repeating myself I will only remind you that I have a clear concise list of bills that you can find under our party tab. 
<br><br>
Upon my electing there will be immediate proposals of several bills as well as an amendment to the citizens charter in order to better safeguard our rights.
<br><br>
I will not pander to you or ply you with lies but simply remind you to choose wisely.
<br><br>
Thank you,
<br><br>
Tom"
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>4. Matpat</b><br>
               The third candidate is Matpat3000, or simply Matpat, a new face in the politics of Medoles. He will be an independent candidate seeking to work with the Innovation Party of Medoles and the Democratic Party. For their campaign, they said: 
            </p>
<blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "While we reminiscence about a past that is gone, it shall not be forgotten. Our past as medolesians should be used as the fuel to progress us into greatness while not holding us back.
<br><br>
And in that I hope to ensure all who live within our borders get a voice and a way to better the livelihood of Medoles through partnership, fairness and one's own ability to improve."
            </blockquote>
<p class="fs-5">

                <b>4. Maytix</b><br> 
                The fourth candidate is Maytix, a member of the Democratic Party in Medoles. In terms of their goals for Senator, they exclaim: "I want to represent french comunity of Medoles with my party and participate to the elaboration of law."
                <br><br>
                <b>5. Xesphor</b><br> 
                The fifth candidate is Xesphor, the sitting Senator seeking re-election as one of the longest-serving Senators of Medoles. He will be running under the banner of the Innovation Party of Medoles (IPM), stating: "I feel like I've been a productive and loyal senator devoted to Medoles. The Senate will be expanding in next two elections and to help make the big change slightly less chaotic I will run for re-election. I also want to hopefully reform provinces to be "districts" going forward."
                <br><br>
                <b>6. Mymy</b><br>
                The last candidate is Mymy, who will be running under the Mymyenese Party. For his campaign, he re-iterated the lyrics to the hit song "Good Luck, Babe!" by Chappell Roan released last year.
