                    28th of May 2025</i>
                <br><br>
                After a historical Senatorial election that will likely shape the very future of Medoles for the foreseeable future, we will now be able to tackle the Presidential election. After two terms and 4 months for the incumbent President Tree, his reign at the helm of Medolite politics will come to a close. In his place, four potential candidates will take their chance: Tired_Pride, Unicorn, Mymy, and SherlockChow.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Tired_Pride</b><br>
                Tired_Pride is the first to have signed up in this election. They are a newcomer to Medoles as a whole and are the reason behind the wave of immigration in recent days. They are a candidate for the new Party of Gay Depression and they will be launching their campaign by commenting: "BRING BACK THE MARRIAGE BOT."
                <br><br>
                <b>2. Unicorn</b><br>
                The second candidate to join in is Unicorn. They joined Medoles a little over a month ago and have recently decided to get involved in Medoles and its politics as a member of the Arborist Movement of Medoles (AMM). They are kicking off by saying:
        
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Hello y'all!!!!  I would like to ask for your support to become president of Medoles. I would like to create more events and keep our strong community&lt;3. 
                <br><br>
                1. I would like to create events such as a pride events to create  a pride logo for the server.
                <br><br>
                2. Create a cat and Dog event to show all your amazing animals&lt;3.
                <br><br>
                3. Lobby the senate for a Ministry of foreign affairs." <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>3. Mymy</b><br>
                Mymy, also known by their username of finniniow, is the third candidate in this election. Alongside Unicorn, they will be representing the AMM to establish a monarchy in Medoles. They recently participated in the latest, yet historic, Senatorial election and will try once again with the Presidential election by saying: "Dear people of Medoles, even tho I lost the recent senator elections. I still hope to maybe change your vote, if you vote on me. You can with and my other fellow party members lay the first few bricks towards a monarchy!"
                <br><br>
                <b>4. SherlockChow</b><br>
                The fourth and final candidate in this election is SherlockChow. Sherlock has been around since January as a Senator under the Medoles Popular Front, one of the pillar parties of Medolite politics in the last 5 months and has participated in the recent MOF eGames in Snagov. Sherlock hopes to come back to the politics of Medoles as the President. When asked about his campaign, he commented: 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Hello fellow medolite siblings! I am Sherlock, member of the Medolite Popular Front and former senator of our nation. I've served a few terms and written some legislation with the rest of the party that improved and shaped our country, and I think it's important for someone who is running for a position such as the president to have collaborated with the legislative branch before. 
                My plans for Medoles are to start making events and create a more friendly and inclusive environment for everyone. While being on the lookout for alliances and partnerships with other micronations, while also trying to join different intermicronational events like the ones that the MOF hosts yearly.
                I ask for your vote for a better Medoles and s better community, no more and no less.
                <br><br>
                :3"
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                With the four candidates out of the way, this will be a refreshing election for a possible new face to represent Medoles on the micronational stage.
