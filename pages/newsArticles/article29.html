                <br><br>
                We're nearing the middle of August, and the 15th Senatorial Election for Medoles is approaching. Amidst the shake-ups in the Medolite sphere, four candidates are presenting themselves to shed light on Medoles, where we will have a full 5-seat Senate. Those four candidates are Quinnlyn de Sanguine, Maytix, Seal de Sanguine, and Unicorn von Brier. 
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Seal de Sanguine</b><br>    
               The first to have signed up is Seal de Sanguine, also known by her username "The_Seally_Seal". Seal is running as an independent candidate. When asked about her electoral campaign, she replied: "As most of you know, I'm not a good politician, but I am attempting to join in the senate to be the change I want to see in Medoles. I am going to make the server more of a safe space and less of a constant argument broken up by people saying some... interesting things. I'll say it straight, I want to make the server more strict to make everyone comfortable and more including. That is my speech. It's seal time am I right?"

                <br><br>
               <b>2. Quinnlyn de Sanguine</b><br> 
               The second candidate on the list is Quinnlyn de Sanguine, also known by their username "tiredpride."  Like Seal, they are an independent candidate.  When discussing their platform for Senator, Quinnlyn stated: "I'd like to keep Medoles from falling apart, by bringing new ideas and making sure the citizens of Medoles are satisfied :3"
                <br><br> 
                <b>3. Unicorn von Brier</b><br> 
                The third to sign up is Unicorn von Brier, also known as "not_thatsmart". Unicorn will be running in this election as a member of the Innovation Party of Medoles (IPM). In relations to their electoral campaign, they said: "I will purpose bills to help the server!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3"
                <br><br>
                <b>4. Maytix</b><br> 
                The fourth and last candidate in this election is Maytix, a representative for the Democratic Party. When asked about their speech for this election, they stated: "I want to be a Senator to help the community improve itself through new laws, new institutions, and new activities. As a French citizen, I also want to represent the French community here. In addition, as a law student, I can bring my legal expertise to support the development and implementation of Senate bill."
