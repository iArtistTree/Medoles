                <br><br>
                The race for the position of Mayor of Medoles has officially begun. Indeed, the signups opened earlier this week, on the 29th of December. With them closing yesterday night, we can finally reveal the possible candidates for the upcoming elections. This time around, there is a record attendance of 5 options to choose from that could shape the future of the Medolite people. 
                <br><br>
                The first signup comes from Hoku_clan, or simply Hoku, who recently joined Medoles earlier this month and aspires to change Medoles by forming the "Communist Party". In regards to his candidacy, he comments: "I wanna be mayor POTATOES FOR ALL."
                <br><br>
                The second candidate in question is TheArtistTree or just Tree. He is the first and current mayor of Medoles, allowing him to establish the first set of bills to pass. The independent candidate states: "As the mayor of Medoles, as we begin to settle in, I'd like to help propel our reach via foreign exchanges and put ourselves on the map. On top of that, I'd like to aid in forging the Medolite identity." 
                <br><br>
                The third in the running is aftermathsupremacy, also known as Lily. Lily is also a leading figure in Communist Zelmadia, a nation in which Medoles has recently established official relations. As the representative and founding member of the "Medoles Communist Party" or the MCP, he exclaims in his campaigning speech: "As Thy Mayor, I will lead Medoles to greatness by using communism. I will first configure the bots so it can't be exploited. And then I will make The Security better to let out raiders and bad people. and finally i will get it to 100 members."
                <br><br>
                On the flip side, we have our fourth candidate who represents independently; Toojla. Similar to Lily, Toolja has a governmental position in a nation Medoles has official relations with, this time Rudharta. This is his comments in regards to his electoral campaign: "Good morning/afternoon/evening, citizens of Medoles. I, as a candidate for the mayoral position in Medoles will not promise anything but a democracy that is enhanced and more efficient for the people of Medoles. And I need your help, in giving me suggestions to do so. To be a public servant, is to take action, and protect the constitution ratified by the people, for the people."
                <br><br>
                Lastly, we are left with our final candidate: SherlockChow. He is a running candidate as our most recent citizen. Despite being new, he is ready for a fresh challenge with this to say: "Fellow siblings of Medoles. I became captivated by the idea and values behind our nation at first sight of such a beautiful country. I seek to help out as many people as I can and aid our nation in any way possible. And as these signups arise, I feel that I could really contribute to Medoles in such position from which I can make proposals. Personally, I adhere to the ideals of freedom of speech, class abolition, civil rights and wealth redistribution, moreover, I think it's crucial for ourselves to develop a sense of culture, which is why I'll try to prioritise bills that promote artistic expression, academic development and symbolism creation. I'm sure that the other candidates in this run think much alike me and I hope Medoles can truly grow as a community."
                <br><br>
                This election will be the largest in Medoles to date, with 5 candidates competing for the position of Mayor. The voting will take place on Thursday, the 2nd of January 2025, and conclude the following day on Friday, the 3rd of January. Happy New Year.
