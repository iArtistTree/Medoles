                The Senatorial Elections are back with a new round, with Helium and PinkMappre's at stake. We have senatorial candidates new and old, to represent the Medolite people for the term in March, bringing innovative ideas to the table. Let's meet our four candidates.
                <br><br>
                First on the list is PinkMappre, also known as Remi more recently. She's been around for some months and has always been forward with her ideas and for change. She is currently a senator and representing the newly formed Non-Conforming party. Here is her campaign speech: "Vote for me and you’ll never have to vote again! (I’ll keep voting optional, you’re never required to vote, but I’d still like yours!)"
                <br><br>    
                The second to come up is a newer member with a growing interest in Medoles: Hedgelaird. Notably known for his involvement in chess, he is running independently for this term with this to say: "I'm running for two reasons: to break deadlocks and enact your policies as directly and literally as possible. I have no ideology, agenda, or scruples of any kind. Whatever you want to fly, I'm your guy."
                <br><br>
                Next is SherlockChow, a respectable citizen who has been around for a couple of months working to expand and promote the Medolite culture thanks to the MLSG. He is a notable member of the Communist Party of Medoles (CPM) and strives for a role in the government like his former peers. This is his campaign speech: "Fellow citizens of Medoles, I want to work with the senate to pass quality-of-life and security bills that will make our community thrive such as discussing the implementation of an auto-mod bot, private thread tickets, put forward several national symbols bills from the Medolite Lore and Symbols Guild, make periodical activities like contests, movie nights or game nights. I'd also like to formalize the Bureau of Public Outreach/Office of Public Affairs and perhaps work on adding a levelling bot and quests or fun missions to do while on the server for new members to gain privileges (embedding links, posting photos, etc.)"
                <br><br>
                The final candidate to sign up and compete is fishguy, also known as Markus Ogalsson. Similar to Hedgelaird, he is a relatively recent citizen, but wishes to make his mark on Medoles' history books nonetheless with his party: Free Corps of Medoles (FCM) to strengthen the Medolite identity. When asked about his campaign, he said: "Vote Me for Progress and Anticommunism. We will make Medoles more Powerful than it ever been."
