                As May is nearing, so is a new Senator election. There are two seats up for grabs, and neither Hedgelaird nor SherlockChow are re-running to keep their post. This means we'll have a new batch of potentially new faces to keep ideas fresh for the betterment of Medoles and its people. In this article, we'll introduce you to the four candidates that are running this time around.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Cynthia</b><br>
                The first potential Senator to sign up is one we've commonly seen in recent elections: Hopelesstyrant, otherwise known as Cynthia. She is a candidate for the Medoles Popular Front who's been pushing to make her mark in politics throughout April. Cynthia launches her campaign with this speech:
                <br>
            </p>
    <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
        The limitations of Discord has become the Achilles heel of our proud and Most Serene Republic, and it becomes apparent every passing day that the flaws which plague us must be corrected.
        <br><br>
        It is for that reason that, along my push for the formation of a Foreign Ministry, I will draft a bill proposal to form a Royal House, with President Tree and his relations at the head of it. This Royal House will have control of affairs of state in a very limited capacity, with full details to be worked out at a later date.
        <br><br>                
        As mentioned too, I will continue my push for a Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to aid the President in all foreign affairs. We must pursue relation building with the micronations we host now, instead of trying to branch out constantly. We cannot expect to continue our growth sustainably, and there will come a point where we can no longer sustain it.
        <br><br>               
        Ladies and Gentlemen with whom I have the honour of sharing this nation, it is high time we vote for common sense legislation which will cut on chaos and help build a nation we can continue to proudly call home!
    </blockquote>
    <p class="fs-5">
    <b>2. X-Man</b><br>
    The second candidate is a familiar face, X-Man. As one of our founders, he will represent the Innovative Party of Medoles (IPM) and is ready to come back into the ring of politics after a month's break. He signed up commenting: 
    </p>
    <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
        I will work to preserve the essence of Medoles, democracy. There should not be a tyranny of a senate that should so easily hijack democracy with simple majorities. I will prevent this by keeping the constitutional requirement of only 40% of senators agreeing to propose legislation. Secondly, I will preserve democracy by ensuring there is no "royalty" as suggested by other members. It is important to allow the citizens to elect every role, and individuals to be allowed to assist in diplomacy. Ultimately, this race comes down to the ideas of democracy vs monarchy. I will work on policies to codify heads of departments and how departments should be created. 
    </blockquote>

    <p class="fs-5">
        <b>3. PinkMappre</b><br>
        PinkMappre, also known as Remi is the third to join this election. Remi is a former Senator who, just like X-Man wishes to join in once again in the politics of Medoles. She will be representing the Medoles Popular Front (MPF) with this comment: "What Cynthia said :3"
        <br><br>
        <b>4. Anthony G.</b><br>
        The fourth candidate is a brand new face for the elections: Saspearian, more commonly known as Anthony. He is an independent candidate who joined Medoles earlier this month to bring fresh ideas. Here is his speech for this campaign: 
    </p>
    <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
        As a Senator of Medoles, I aim to assist in boosting diplomatic relations with other micronations, formalizing diplomatic relations, increasing Medoles' presence on social media, and ensuring that the needs of citizens are being addressed.
        <br><br>
        This April, elect Anthony G. to the Senate. A vote for Anthony is a vote for diplomatic growth.
