                <br><br>
                September and Autumn are around the corner in a couple of weeks, and so is another Senatorial election. This time, three candidates will be competing for the two contested Senate seats: Noah de Sanguine, Matpat, and Cynthia de Sanguine.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Noah de Sanguine</b><br>    
               Noah de Sanguine, also known as Incineroar359, is the first candidate to have signed up. They will be running in this election independently and wish to keep their current Seat in the Senate. When asked about their campaign speech, they replied: "I'm Noah one of Medoles current senators and I'm running to renew my position in my initial campaign speech I promised to be active and a person that'll care for every single Medolite and I've kept to this promise shown through the three act I proposed during this term such as The Art Gallery of Medoles (failed), The Translator Act (Success) a bill made to support our bilingual and non english speaking citizens, and lastly The Date and Time Clarification Act (Success) a bill made to clear up confusion about event and elections times and dates."

                <br><br>
               <b>2. Matpat</b><br> 
               The second to run for the ballot is Matpat, a more recent face in Medolite politics and another incumbent Senator wishing to keep his seat. Just like Noah, they will run as an independent candidate. In terms of their campaign, they stated: "I hope to be reelected into senate so that we can continue the work on improving Medoles. While what we done so far is small, it is just the beginning for a brighter future for Medoles and it's people."
                <br><br>
                <b>3. Cynthia de Sanguine</b><br> 
                Lastly, we have Cynthia de Sanguine, a returning face after a break from Medolite politics. They have decided to revive the Arborist Movement of Medoles (AMM) and wish to represent them in this upcoming election. For their electoral campaign, they said: "It's clear that we've seen a delay or rather a slowing down of our usual vigor. Medoles is generally a place of life and activity. It seems as though those days could be coming to an end. But that doesn't need to be the case. We have in our abilities the capacity to bounce back from this lull in activity with an jumpstart. A tremendous up start of energy which we've always had. We just need to right tools to trigger such a boost of energy. With me in office, we may very well get the tools needed."
                <br><br>
                We'll see how this election develops, as it could be a potential turning point for the future of Medoles. Stay tuned for more.
