                <br><br>
                The race for the Senate is on! With the signups for the 6th Senatorial elections closed, we now know the candidates competing in this election starting tomorrow. In this article, we'll reveal the three candidates.
<br><br>
<b>1. Crow</b><br>
The first to sign up was beel.z, more commonly known as Crow. They are the founder of the new and yet-to-be-known political party of Royal Avian Colonies. They are relatively new citizen who's been making a name for themselves in the recent wave of newcomers in Medoles. When asked about their campaign, they commented: "hi im me idk what's this for im just doing this."
<br><br>
<b>2. Shtuffs</b><br>
On the other side of the spectrum, we have Shtuffs as our second candidate. Shtuffs is one of the first citizens of Medoles after the Founders and has been at the helm of the Judicial branch for almost a year. He's been critical of the system and wishes to push for changes. In that regard, this is what he has to say:            
</p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                There are many issues and inconsistencies present in both the Constitution and the laws we have passed.
                <br><br>
                There are many legal grey areas that have not been fleshed out yet, such as the procedures of the courts as well as a specific regulation of the executive's powers.
                <br><br>            
                Much of the legislation is bloated with filler that muddles the clarity of the nation's laws.
                <br><br>                
                The Chief Justice currently holds too much power, as the one judge unilaterally in charge of interpreting all of the nation's laws.
                <br><br>               
                There are many other things I can list, but overall there has been a lack of clear leadership in the nation's legislature. As a Senator, I promise I will take charge and set clear precedents to help establish a more robust legal framework for the nation's government to spring off of.

                <b>3. Cynthia</b><br>
                The remaining candidate is from the recent Senatorial race: hopelesstyrant aka Cynthia. She's the incumbent President of Valrun, a micronation close to the Medolite heart. She wishes to represent in this election under the banner of the Medoles Popular Front. She'd like to bring some of her ideas onto the table by exclaiming:

                The Platform I am running on is the platform I have run on in the past. Streamlining and efficiency. We need to push for protection of our digital borders. This means a stringent entry process to weed out bad apple from the basket before they spoil the bunch. We also need to develop the relations we already have. This means forming a Foreign Affairs Ministry to assist the President in organising relations, drafting treaties and agreements, and taking some of the load off the President - giving our Head of State the ability to work harder for all of us!
                <br>
                To do better, we must vote better - Vote Cynthia for Senate!
