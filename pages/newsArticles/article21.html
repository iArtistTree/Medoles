                June and the summer are dawning on us, so is a new election cycle with the Senatorial elections. The weather is not the only thing heating up, as this election is bound to heat up with the latest political discussions. The newest hot topic mostly surrounds the state of democracy and the rise of monarchism. The 9th Senatorial election will have five candidates hoping to resolve this issue, dividing Medoles for the past weeks. These candidates are: Canbine, Cynthia, Blappa,  Mymy, and Butter, which we will tackle in this article.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Canbine</b><br>
                The first candidate to have signed up is Canbine. He has been a long-standing citizen for almost 6 months, and he has a strong sense of French pride among the Franco-Medolite community. Canbine is also notably the founder of the Office of Public Affairs. For this campaign, he starts off commenting: 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Mes Camarades, Je vous salue! 
                <br><br>
                Let's keep this short
                <br><br>
                With that opening it might seem like I might affiliate myself with the MPF or those Valrunite neighbors of ours however I can assure you I am no dirty communist. Being a native born MÃ©dolois I have pledged myself to our most Serene Republic. However it is of my opinion that as of late, our most glorious nation has been corrupted by foreign infiltrates who bear the names of mankind`s most foul plagues. My first promise as senator, if I am to be elected, is to draft legislation to combat the swarms of incessant  creatures that assail our borders and let only those worthy of the title of Medolite to enter this most perfect of states.  My second pledge however is to deliver on a long, long promise of mine. To finally get the Office of Public events up and running so that things such as game-nights, community events, and even cultural artistry can come to fruition. While I have long delayed these promises due to personal matters I believe now is the time for action to occur and I believe I am worthy enough to do it.
                <br><br>
                Merci de votre temps"<br>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>2. Cynthia</b><br>
                Cynthia, also known by their username of hopelesstyrant, is the second to have joined the election. They've been a citizen and incumbent Senator in Medoles for some time, notably known for their experience in Valrun. For this election, they will represent a new party they've founded: The Arborist Movement of Medoles (AMM). The AMM's goal is to establish an elective monarchy in Medoles. Here is what Cynthia had to say for this election:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "My fellow Medolites,<br>
                As I campaign to maintain my seat in the Senate, I'd like to remind you all of my resume and what I got done in a single month.
                <br><br>
                Prior to my election, and even prior to my entrance to Medoles, I was the Founder and Head of State of my own dear Valrun, and she will be turning six years old next month, no small thanks to the dedication of myself and my fellow Valerites.
                <br><br>
                When I came here, I didn't think I'd be making it as far as I have today, and now I'm at the tail end of my first term and I'd like to remind my fellow countrymen and women that I managed to accomplish some of what I campaigned on for my first term. I got us the Roleplay Forum and the Citizen's Charter. The roleplay forum has given some people some limited enjoyment, and when there's more free time this summer, I don't doubt that it'll provide more. As well, the Citizen's Charter was the first, and the biggest, leap forward for our civil rights - as we never had such a thing before.
                <br><br>
                If re-elected, I'd finish what I started. I'll draft and introduce to the Senate a bill to form a Foreign Affairs Ministry, a bill to add more highly sought after bots to the Discord, and last but not least, I'd work with the President, Courts, Senate and all of you to hash out a bill to transform us into a modern, shining beacon of Constitutional Monarchy within the Micronational Community
                <br><br>
                When you go to vote in under 72 hours, cast your ballot for a woman who got stuff done, and will continue to get stuff done. Thank you."
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>3. Blappa</b><br>
                The third candidate in this list is Blappa. Blappa is a cat appreciator who seeks to make his mark in Medoles after running in the previous Senatorial election. He is an independent candidate who will be kicking off this campaign by saying: "im a cool boppa cat so make me in da senate."
                <br><br>
                <b>4. Mymy Zedong</b><br>
                Next would be Mymy Zedong, who also goes by the username of finnioniw. Along with Cynthia, they will be representing the AMM to establish a monarchy in Medoles and shake up the system. When asked about their campaign, they commented: "The presidential system, is becoming bland and boring for the average citizen. I and with my fellow members of the MLM, want to establish a monarchist Medoles. With a powerful and symbolic head of state, that can strengthen our unity and internal peace!"
                <br><br>
                <b>5. Butter</b><br>
                The last candidate to have joined this electric election is Butter, otherwise known as the user of sirkeem8. Butter is an active citizen and police officer in the MPD who's been pushing stride for stride to improve Medoles. They are a driving force in the immigration department and wish to throw their hat back into the ring of politics once again. Here is his campaign speech: "Medoles is in danger, our democracy is threatened. We must rally together to defend it and keep out those who would see our freedom destroyed. I will work to maintain our democracy, and I will do as the people want. Keep out the monarchists and keep Medoles safe and strong."
                <br><br>
                This will be a heated election that could change the very fate of this micronation we dearly love. Tomorrow will kick off this once-in-a-lifetime election.
