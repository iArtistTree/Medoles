                This week has plenty to offer, with ongoing senatorial elections and appointments for the new positions in the Medolite government. Today, we'll discuss the candidates running for the Senator elections, their candidates, the results of the recent Presidential elections, and what changes it involves. 
                <br><br>
                First and foremost, as it is routine, we'll introduce the two candidates running for the Senator Elections: X-Man and SherlockChow. The two of them will be competing for the last seat in the Senate, joining with PinkMappre and Helium. 
                <br><br>
                Let's start with X-Man: One of the founding members and former President of Medoles. He represents the Innovation Party of Medoles (IPM) and ensures we'll be progressing as a micronation. This is what he has to say: "Hello my name is X-Man former President of Medoles and founder of Medoles, For my senatorial term I will work on creating thought out and advanced legislation to accurately set up foundational systems within Medoles. I will do this by setting up a system for executive departments, more detailed outlook on news stations, and events. I will assist any senator or citizen in making legislation to put forward what are good ideas and liked ideas."
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, we have SherlockChow who represents the Communist Party of Medoles (CPM). He is becoming an established citizen in Medoles who has contributed by supporting his former partymate during her tenure as Mayor. Here is his campaign speech: "Fellow citizens of Medoles, my name is Sherlock and I come to you with the proposal of working with our senate to ensure good quality bills that will promote the creation of our culture and identity as medolites. As a member of CPM, I worked with the former mayor of Medoles to put forward many bills that have been accepted by now. I think that If we work together, we could build an amazing and friendly community within this nation. Thank you for listening â™¡." 
                <br><br>
                Lastly, let's briefly go over last week's appointment of the first president under the new constitution: TheArtistTree. He is one of the three founders of Medoles as well as the first mayor. One of his first acts, with the help of the Senate, appointed Shtuffs as the new Chief of Justice who was the now abolished Judge role.
