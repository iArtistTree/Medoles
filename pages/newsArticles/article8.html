                <br><br>
                As the sun sets on 2024, a new year begins with a new mayor. The mayoral election concluded last night, with the results announced earlier today, January 4th, 2025. However, the election was far from uneventful. We'll discuss the changes in parties, voting fraud, results and what we could expect in the following election.
                <br><br>
                First, the election prompted candidates to change their party affiliation.  Three candidates participating: Lily, Hoku, and SherlockChow combined their forces and formed a new party called the Communist Party of Medoles or the CPM. We'll see later how this new partnership might have changed the course of this election.
                <br><br>
                The election wasn't always sunshine and rainbows due to unfortunate circumstances occurring.  One of the candidates, Hoku, was caught publicizing the form to the public. Indeed, the posted it on a public server to attain illegal votes from non-citizens. This action goes directly against the Constitution of Medoles in 3.3.3 and 4.2.1 in the Election section but remains unpunished as of right now. 
                <br><br>
                After resolving the scandal and eliminating fraudulent votes, the results were officially reported. The race was extremely close, with Tree receiving the votes of Toojla, while Lily benefitted from the combined support of the Communist voters who had backed both SherlockChow and Hoku. Ultimately, there was only a 2-vote difference between the candidates. A single vote change could have resulted in a tie, but Lily emerged as the new Mayor of Medoles. Congratulations to Lily.
                <br><br>
                From what we can learn from this latest development in the politics of Medoles, we can observe the emergence of political parties to a scale never seen in months past. A few examples are the CPM mentioned previously, but there is also the rise of the IPM (Innovation Party of Medoles) & the DPPM (Democratic People's Party of Medoles). There is also the chance for new parties to pop up before the next election due to new people joining in. 
                <br><br>
                The next presidential election will begin on January 12th.
