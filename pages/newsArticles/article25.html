Hello fellow citizens of Medoles! Saluton kaj salut! 
<br> <br>
My name is Sherlock, although you may know me in the server by "Mx. Chow", and I come to you to ask for your vote in the upcoming senatorial elections.
<br> <br>
I believe in democracy, autonomy, freedom and the wellbeing of every medolite sibling, I've been a member of the Medolite Popular Front (the oldest still-standing party of our nation, which works to teach and uphold the values of Marxism) and senator of our nation in several instances. You could say I have a bit of experience legislating.
<br> <br>
My plans are simple: keep a rigid stance on democracy and all of its principles (Free and frequent elections, elected public officials, freedom of expression, association and of the press); make our government more transparent; make way for a better system for citizens to propose legislation; secure the laicity and equality within our constitution if the need for a reform arises and finally, work with the executive and legislative sectors to create events and make our community more welcoming to all people."
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>4. Xesphor</b><br>

            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "I would like to say that for my second term my goals are bigger than my first term. <br>
So far what I've done is make provinces of medoles official and the process is yet to be finished. <br>
Going forward i want to make Medoles more inviting by giving provinces more of a purpose and give more than just simple colourful election maps."
