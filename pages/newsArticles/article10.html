                With the new year comes a new Mayor, but also a new President of Medoles. As the discussions in the constitutional convention are heating up, so are the rapidly approaching Presidential elections. Due to time congestion, we will keep this article relatively short, but first, let's introduce the candidates for presidency.
                <br><br>
                First, we have Birdish, an expert in the judicial sector, and a relatively new citizen joining the ranks earlier this year. He's also the leader and founder of the Legal Equity and Advancement Party (LEAP). This is what he has to say: "Citizens of Medoles; I'll keep this speech short and simple; my goal is to reform our judicial and legal infrastructure - and after I have achieved that goal I will sincerely fuck off after one term and not run for re-election. You may be asking; what qualifies me to become president? Well, I have achieved best delegate at various MUN competitions - showing my diplomacy and resolve. I have also watched a season of suits. Thank you for your time."
                <br><br>
                Following this intriguing introduction to the Medoles politician landscape, we have our next candidate; Hoku. He's been in our humble micronation since late December and is a key figure of the Communist Party of Medoles (CPM) with a controversial history in elections. You can learn more about it in our eighth article: "A Fresh Start: A New Mayor for the New Year". This is his electoral speech: "As the president I will to help the great nation of medolite grow! I will work with the mayor to pass new laws and bills, I will also try to ally with as many different countries that have the same views as us as i can!"
                <br><br>
                Finally, the last candidate running for Presidency is PinkMappre. Similar to Birdish, she joined us earlier this year but hasn't joined or founded any current political parties. She'll be running independently and leaving us with a relatively short comment: "We ought to make the pop higher."
                <br><br>
                These three candidates will clash and compete in this presidential election. The voting will open later this week on the 16th of January and close the next day on the 17th of January at 23h59 or 12:59 PM EST. Good luck!
