                    28th of January 2025</i>
                <br><br>
                As one of the main changes under the newly established constitution, the first of many Senate elections is here. Indeed, with the passing of the constitutional amendment last weekend, senators will be replacing the mayor's role as head of the legislative branch. The Senate of Medoles will be composed of 3 senators, 2 of which will be determined by the end of this week. The 3rd Senator will be elected 2 weeks following the current election.
                <br><br>
                The instant the changes in the constitution were finalized, the signups for the brand new Senatorial/Senate elections were off to the races. As of the 28th of January, 6 candidates confirmed to compete for the two available spots: Toojla, Robbie, X-Man, Sherlock, PinkMappre and Helium. Each will be introduced in the following paragraphs. 
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Toojla</b><br>
                Our first candidate to have signed up is Toojla, also known as Aljoot. He is an independent candidate also known for their high governmental position in Rudharta, a nation Medoles has established relations. The former Mayor candidate from the election at the beginning of the year had this to say for his campaign: "Good morning/afternoon/evening, citizens of Medoles. I, as a candidate for a seat in the senate in Medoles will not promise anything but a democracy that is enhanced and more efficient for the people of Medoles. And as a senator, I will do my best to make laws that are going to enhance the efficiency and effectivity of the government of Medoles, which would always abide by the Constitution, ratified by the people."
                <br><br>
                <b>2. Robbie</b><br>
                On a similar note to foreign governmental officials, we have Robbie who comes from Rad Union, another nation we've recently been in contact. They've joined Medoles relatively recently has high hopes to prove themselves among Medolites with this lengthy speech in mind as an independent candidate: 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Why should you vote for me to be a Senator? I have ran my own political simulator for about half a year, as well as having won Parliament and President in other servers. I have seen how good servers rise and how bad servers haven fallen. 
                <br><br>
                Medoles has potential that needs to be invested into, that requires an experienced and passionate leader like me to implement what has proven to be good for democracies and republic servers.
                <br><br>
                I am a very friendly person, which enables me to be able to reach across the aisle should an opposing party win the Parliament. I am grateful for the opportunity of an alliance Medoles had given my server. 
                <br><br>
                Having ran democracies both before and currently, I have learned how to make sure voting becomes and remains more easy, accessible, and rigg-free, ensuring the people's vote matters and keeping the people in charge. 
                <br><br>
                And what about you ðŸ«µ, yes you the citizen, you have the power to provide the server with an experienced, enthusiastic, and collaborative Senator. I encourage you to vote, even if your opinion is not for me, as democracy works better and fulfills its meaning the more you and the rest of the people participate."
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <br><br>
                <b>3. X-Man</b><br>
                The third candidate is X-Man, former President and a founder of Medoles. He's been a veteran among the citizens but still has ideas to express and unfinished business. He's running under the banner of the Innovation Party of Medoles (IPM), and this is what he had to say: "Hello my name is X-Man former President of Medoles and founder of Medoles, For my senatorial term I will work on creating thought out and advanced legislation to accurately set up foundational systems within Medoles. I will do this by setting up a system for executive departments, more detailed outlook on news stations, and events. I will also work against anything that is deemed to be used purely for ideological roleplay like trying to replicate communism by distributing all money equally and controlling all means of production."
                <br><br>
                <b>4. SherlockChow</b><br>
                The fourth in line is SherlockChow, more commonly known as simply Sherlock. While he hasn't been heavily politically involved outside of his candidacy for Mayor earlier this month, he has been key to the success of the Community Party of Medoles (CPM) which he will be representing for this inaugural Senatorial election. He comments: "Greetings, fellow citizens and siblings of Medoles, my name is Sherlock. Only a month has passed since I joined this beautiful country and started developing some really nice relationships, but we have already grown so much and I believe I'm ready to pursue a role in our government as senator. I have worked alongside the former mayor of Medoles and written many bills that aimed to improve our community, but there is still much work to be done and now that we'll have a senate, a greater and more diverse legislation amount will be discussed and voted by the people. I strive for Medoles to become a cultural power, developing the arts, crafts and science of our citizens while making sure an egalitarian and democratic environment is always in place. Some of the bills I'd love to work on would be: Creating contests and game nights, working with Canbine to formalize the Bureau of Public Outreach/Office of Public Affairs, creating a judiciary reform civil assembly, starting a lore-writing+vexillology+medoles' symbols working group to further work in our identity as citizens of this nation. I hope, regardless of how the elections turn out, that we can work together and improve Medoles as a whole. We must make this community friendly and welcome to all if we ever want to become even greater than now."
                <br><br>
                <b>5. PinkMappre</b><br>
                For our fifth candidate, we have PinkMappre. She's now been around for a hot minute with always bright ideas to bring forward and will be running independently. Just like this segment, she likes to keep it simple when she says: "Medoles can be greater!"
                <br><br>
                <b>6. Helium</b><br>
                The sixth and final candidate to have signed up is Helium. Just like X-Man, he is one of the founders of Medoles. While relatively quiet, he has still contributed to Medoles from the background and will run in this election as an independent candidate, for now. This is what he had to say for his campaign:  "I want to open Medoles to the Wider world.  I want to keep Medoles alive and prosperous. Plus I would love for Medoles to have a national Animal and Anthem. While I am in the Senate, I want to hold to those Ideas that made the nation and I want to drive Medoles to a brighter future."
                <br><br>
                This has been a doozy of an article with this many candidates on the line. I appreciate you for sticking around and possibly longer with more news around the corner while this series of elections is on its way!</b>
