                    <br>
                    1st of April 2025</i>
                <br><br>
                The presidential candidates are revealed, and the race is on. In the last few weeks, there has been a surge in population growth among Medolites, which is allowing for a potentially exciting election season. We have three candidates: Tree, Butter, and Cynthia. We will give an overview of each in the following paragraphs.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Tree</b><br>
                The first on the list is TheArtistTree, also known as Tree. Tree is one of the founders of Medoles, and he has been the current sitting president since early February. He is representing the Innovation Party of Medoles (IPM), as such, he has and will prioritize the stability and wellbeing of Medoles: "I will seek to collaborate with the Senate and ensure the security of our border. On top of this, I will hope to establish relations with other micronations and link up with the greater Micronational community."
                <br><br>
                <b>2. Butter</b><br>
                The second candidate to sign up to bring change to Medoles is sirkeem8, commonly known as Butter. Butter has been a longstanding citizen of Medoles for some months, and a cadet of the Medoles Police Department (MPD). Furthermore, he is at least to some extent the reason behind the surge in activity in Medoles and the strengthening of a national identity. He left this comment for his electoral campaign: "Boykissing for everybody unless you don't like that typa thing then the typa kissin you do like."
                <br><br>
                <b>3. Cynthia</b><br>
                The third and final candidate to bring herself into the spotlight is HopelessTyrant, or simply Cynthia. While Cynthia isn't a veteran citizen, she is the President of Valrun and she has been at the forefront of developing a friendly relationship between Valrun and Medoles. For the duration of this electoral campaign, she will be representing the Medoles Popular Front (MPF) with this speech: 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Comrades, I aim to pursue a campaign of good vibes for all. Domestically, I will work with the Senate to pursue a stringent entry system for all newcomers modeled after Valrun's system, to weed out trolls and disruptive people. Likewise, I'll push for more art-related activities on a monthly basis. 
                <br><br>
                For foreign policy, I'd like to see a strong development of the relations we already have, not just simply reaching out to whoever. The workload will eventually become too much for future presidents. Relating to Foreign Policy, I'll work to try and establish a Foreign Affairs Ministry to assist the President in all matters of diplomacy. 
                <br><br>
                This presidency should be one of streamlining and efficiency and that is what you'll get with a vote for me."
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                We've taken the time to discuss and gloss over all three candidates running for President. This election could be a turning point for the future of Medoles with the ever-increasing changes and the population surge in recent weeks.
