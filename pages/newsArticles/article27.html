                The Presidential term of Unicorn is coming to an end, and with that, a new President shall take their place. In this article, we'll be exploring the five candidates competing for Presidency: Hedgelaird, Shtuffs, Tom Ombre, Mymy, and Seal.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Seal de Sanguine</b><br>    
               The first candidate to sign up is Seal de Sanguine, also known by her username of ebbaxter13. She wishes to run in this campaign under the banner of "Seal's party of the Server": A potentially brand new party in Medoles, which has little to no information at the time of writing. Seal has been a popular face in the Medolite space, but hasn't had their time to shine yet on the political scene. When asked about their Presidential campaign, they commented: "I'm not claiming to be a good politician. Hell, I hate politics, but I love this server. I will work not to improve the micronation, that's a later project, but to improve the server. I want this place to be welcoming and friendly, not a toxic cesspool of arguing. So, vote me if you care more about this server than politics."
                <br><br>
               <b>2. Tom Ombre</b><br> 
               Next in line is Tom Ombre. He'll be representing the National Prosperity Party of Medoles (NPPM). Tom has been a recently recurring figure in Medolite politics, and seeks to make an impact in our most serene republic. He campaigned for this election stating:
                
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "My fellow Medolites,
                <br><br>
                As your president I would serve you all in an upstanding way by increasing our diplomatic ties with like minded nations, expanding our department of Events (BPO) to have many more fun activities to participate in and perhaps to even fund a small Minecraft server, as well as representing the state in a much more active and meaningful manner.
                <br><br>
                Make the wise choice,
                <br><br>
                Thank you
                <br><br>
                Tom"
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>3. Hedgelaird von Brier</b><br>
               Hedgelaird von Brier is the third candidate on the list. He is a former Senator and party leader of the LP and TAP, but this time around he'll be running as an independent candidate. When asked about his campaign, he says: "A nation doesn't deserve your allegiance if its government doesn't earn your trust. I'll hold up my end of the deal, I trust you'll hold up yours."
                <br><br>
                <b>4. Mymy Schoppenboer</b><br> 
                Following that, the fourth candidate is Mymy, also known as finnioniw. They are a well-known face in the Medolite political sphere, and will be running under the new Mymyense Party. Their campaign: "hi."
                <br><br>
                <b>5. Shtuffs</b><br> 
                The final Presidential candidate to have signed up for this rare election is Shtuffs. He'll be running in this election as an independent candidate. Shtuffs is generally known for his role as a former Senator and Chief Justice. When discussing his campaign, he stated: 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "The office of the Presidency is that of many roles:
<br><br>
As the commander in chief of the Medoles Police Department, I will make sure that the police serves the people instead of serving their own self satisfaction. I will try my hardest to make sure that no citizen will live in fear of unfair punishments resulting from incompetence or spite. If an accident ever does occur with the enforcement of the law, I will make sure to rectify any injustices, making sure to stay impartial in the process.
<br><br>
As the Chief Ambassador, I promise to play a more active role in reaching out to foreign nations and carefully crafting alliances for our own benefit. I will make sure that our alliances are meaningful and do not exist to just clutter up our list of relations.
<br><br>
As the head of government, I promise to form a cabinet of experienced department heads chosen based off of merit and expertise. I will keep my subordinates accountable and make sure they act professionally and lawfully. In particular, I will try to promote more activity within the Bureau of Public Outreach to create more fun events for the server and induce more activity.
<br><br>
As the leader of the people, I seek unity and cooperation over grudges that may rock the stability of our nation. I promise to mediate any potential conflicts that may bubble up, seeking a peaceful resolution. At the same time, I will not let malicious actors run free and harm the nation; I will act quickly to end the current secessionist crisis, working swiftly to appoint a prosecutor to bring traitors to justice.
<br><br>
As an executor of laws, I promise to faithfully adhere to the rule of law and put aside my personal biases when carrying out existing laws that were democratically voted in by the will of the people; as a former chief justice, I am intimately familiar with the laws of the nation and its inner workings. At the same time, I will coordinate with the Senate and the people to help pass and enact new legislation to further serve the interests of the nation. I will continue working on forming a new organized legal code for the laws of the nation and instituting new reforms for the Senate to ensure higher quality bills are drafted.
<br><br>
And as a civil servant serving the nation and the constitution it runs under, I promise to treat the office of the Presidency with the respect it deserves. I will conduct myself professionally when important situations demand it, but I will not treat myself so seriously as to come off as a king. My hope is to establish a precedent that will encourage future presidents to act the same."
