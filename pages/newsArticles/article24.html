            </b></p>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <i><b>Author(s):</b> TheArtistTree
                    <br>
                    18th of June 2025</i>
                <br><br>
                Amidst the hot summer of June, we are ready for a big shake-up in the Senate, as two seats will be in contention this week! Canbine and Butter will not be running for re-election, which means we are bound to see new faces this time around. It will be a massive election as six candidates compete for people's attention and votes: Freeman, Hedgelaird, Cynthia, Mymy, Tom Ombre, and Sherlock Chow. In this article, we will seek to explore each candidate.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Freeman</b><br>    
                Freeman, also known by his username "forgetaboutfreeman_", is the first to sign up for this Senatorial election. He is an independent candidate who has been around for some months. Freeman is mostly known for his entrepreneurship in fishing and the rising movement for the soda "Dr Pepper".  He will be kicking off his political career by stating: "If you would like to have quality representation in your government and a senator that actually cares and listens for the people and not some political family, vote for me."
                <br><br>
                <b>2. Hedgelaird</b><br>
                The second on the list is Hedgelaird von Brier. He is a former Senator who wishes to come back into the ring of politics after a successful stint at the helm of "! THE ! ACTION ! PARTY !". This time around, he will be representing the Arborist Movement of Medoles (AMM). When asked about his campaign, he replied:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "We're entering an unusual time in Medoles. It's tense, and with it comes disturbances to the serenity of the republic.
                <br><br>
                Now, of all times, it's especially important to elect senators that can make peace. Senators that can see all sides of an issue and build bridges between opposing parties. Senators who defend law and order, and that live by consistent principles and value the will of the people above their own projects.
                <br><br>
                All I'm asking you to do is vote for that kind of senator, whoever they are.
                <br><br>
                But whoever you vote for, vote for peace."

            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>3. Cynthia</b><br>
                Following Hedgelaird is another member of the AMM: Cynthia. She is the founding member of the party and seeks to establish a constitutional monarchy in Medoles. Cynthia has garnered quite a name for herself with the popular vote in the Political sphere following her past tenure as Senator. She has been loud and clear about her goals as a Senator, affirming: 

            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "It should seem blatantly obvious to everyone who I am and what I stand for. <br>
                The winds of fortune have blown in favour for myself and the greater Arborist Movement, and it is clear that the popularity and the overall curiosity garnered for a monarchy have grown.
                While this is not a push to have you join the bandwagon, it IS an invitation to have your curiosity go somewhere. To have what you imagine a Medolite Monarchy is, become reality.
                <br><br>
                The time of the gross opulence, the needless pomp and circumstance and faceless disconnect of former monarchies - and especially the Absolute Monarchies is over. 
                <br><br>
                Here in Medoles, a monarch should be one who you already talk to. Someone you already trust. Not some stranger with a shoddy track record.
                <br><br>
                With us in office, that's what you're getting: <br>
                A Monarch that already knows your name. <br>
                A Monarch that has earned your trust. <br>
                A Monarch who hasn't squandered it.
                <br><br>
                So by voting Arborist, you're voting for a future that will be familiar."
            <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>4. Mymy</b><br>
                On a similar note, the Medolian Bourbons Party (MBP) will have Mymy representing them in this election, a familiar face in the politics of Medoles. They've participated in multiple elections, voicing their party's vision and values. Unlike the AMM, the MBP wishes to establish an absolute monarchy. When questioned about their campaign, Mymy states:  
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Dear civilians of Medoles,
                <br><br>
                We must stand united against the waves of liberal politicians, trying to disrupt our peace, and to break our unity. They are traitors, and deserve no place in this beloved nation. I therefore call all of you to vote on the MBP and on me, for a greater Medoles!
                <br><br>
                Vive la monarchie! Vive la Medoles!"
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>5. Tom Ombre</b><br>
                The fifth candidate to sign up for this election is Tom Ombre. Formerly associated with the MBP, Tom has since branched off to form his own centrist political group: the National Prosperity Party of Medoles (NPPM). The NPPM aims to bring progress and development to Medoles by building on its existing foundations. Tom hopes to make his mark in politics by saying:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "My fellow Melodians, long have we been subjected to the corrupt laws of our democracy, crushed under the boot of the MPD and their unjust policing and infringement of our rights.
<br><br>
Long have we suffered at the hands of ineffective, wasteful, and idle politicians who look no further than to line their own pockets! Those same politicians who have promised us a grand and beautiful future but have not pushed us in any direction other than backwards! 
<br><br>
Fear not though my fellow Melodians for we, the MBP, have come to change the status quo! Behind us we shall have a stronger more united Medoles! A Medoles of a golden age of expansion and exploration! "
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>6. SherlockChow</b><br>
                Last, but not least, Sherlock Chow will be the final candidate in this upcoming election under the banner of the Medoles Popular Front. He has been around Medoles since January and consistently pushed for change and progress in Medoles during and out of his term as Senator. Sherlock wants to come back into the political sphere by launching his campaign exclaiming:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Fellow medolite citizens, my plans for Medoles if I get elected are to secure democracy, write a better transparency bill, give legal importance to our national languages and ensure a secular government. I want to work alongside other senators and the president to make events and fun activities for our nation.
<br><br>
My only desired for Medoles are democracy, wellbeing and a welcoming community for everyone."
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                This will be a hotly debated candidacy for two potential seats in this election! Make sure to vote as every vote could matter in this election and could shape the future of Medoles.
