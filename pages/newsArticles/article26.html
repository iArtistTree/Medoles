                With the recent heatwaves of July, the political scene is about to heat up with the beginning of a new election cycle and a new Senatorial election. Two seats are up for grabs, but five senators are going to be competing for it: Cynthia, Tom Ombre, Cheezcake, Freeman, and Mymy.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Cynthia de Sanguine</b><br>    
               Let's start with Cynthia de Sanguine, also known as "hopelesstyrant" who is the first to have signed up for this election. She is currently a Senator who has had a history on the political scene of Medoles. Cynthia is also the leading figure of the Arborist Movement of Medoles (AMM), a party whose goal revolved around installing a constitutional monarchy in Medoles. When asked about her campaign, she responded:
                
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "While my most recent term was a rather squandered one, due to an overwhelming amount of things out of my control - I can assure everyone that who I am and what I stand for have not changed.
                <br><br>
                While I may not have had the time over the past month to get the job done, with enough time and effort from myself and my friends in the AMM, we can finally accomplish what we wanted to since the beginning - Answer the Monarchy Question once and for all, placing Tree d'Arbor on the throne.
                We'll also see a State Department bill introduced to vote and hopefully we'll have ourselves an easier way to work closely with our partners.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, at the end of the day, the choice is yours. You can go with a name that you recognise, or try something new!"

            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>2. Tom Ombre</b><br>
               The second on the list is Tom Ombre, the leader of the National Prosperity Party of Medoles (NPPM). He's a rising figure in Medoles who's thriving to make his impact in Medoles with multiple bills in his arsenal. Tom does not shy away from sharing his campaign, exclaiming:

            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "My fellow Citizens, once again I will not try to win you over with noxiously honied or vitriolic words and rhetoric but simply with a list of bills that we at the NPPM have been working to get put forward.
                <br><br>

                Bureau of Archivists Bill | PASSED <br>
                Civil & Criminal Reform Bill | Draft <br>

                Anti-Authoritarian Clause | Draft
                <br><br>
                Make your choice wisely.
                <br><br>
                Tom"

            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>3. Cheezcake</b><br>
                CheezCake is the third on the list, a relatively new member who recently formed the new National Bourgeois Party. While relatively mysterious to the wider public, he does comment on his plans for the Senatorial elections, stating: "Nationalism united via socialism. The economy promise will be here, the state run economy is stable and strong, prosperity shall rise in the great nation once again."
                <br><br>
                <b>4. Freeman de Sanguine</b><br>
                After that, we have Freeman who signed up for another swing in the political ring of Medoles. Despite formerly running as an independent member, this time he will be running under the banner of the Medoles Libertarian Party (MLP). Concerning what he wishes to accomplish if elected, he says: "Wanna see your government work for you, and protect you? Wanna make sure you can express your opinions freely without having the threat of being warned? Vote for me."
                <br><br>
                <b>5. Mymy</b><br>
                The last candidate to have shown up is Mymy, also known as "finnioniw". He is a familiar face in Medolite elections and wishes to push to make an impact. Mymy will be running as an independent candidate with this speech in mind: "כשנתניהו ואייפק משלמים לי כדי שאגיד דברים טובים על ישראל, אני כל כך מתרגש. אני לוקח את הצ'קים וקונה איתם 6 קילו קוקאין. תחי ישראל, יחי פאפי נתניהו. או ביבי, אתה כל כך גדול *מסמיק*, וכשאתה עומד אתה כל כך גבוה, מותק."
