                <br><br>
                As we are finally reaching Pride month, it is time for our first elections in June. Medoles have been making strides on all fronts, including political participation, to build a better future for this beautiful Northern micronation. Following the Presidential election, where we have seen a new face in the Presidency since February, we will have three candidates for the 10th Senatorial election: Cynthia, Xesphor, and Mymy.
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Cynthia</b><br>    
                The first candidate in the list is a reoccurring face in the name of Cynthia, also known by their user of "hopelesstyrant." They are the leading figures of the Arborist Movement of Medoles (AMM), which seeks to instore a monarchy in Medoles. They were a former Senator a month back as part of the Medoles Popular Front, and she wishes to gain her seat back by commenting: 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "My speech is short, simple, and to the point.  
                <br><br>
                
                I stand for the platform I've stood on for the past while.<br>
                - I want to form a Ministry for Foreign Affairs. <br>
                - I want to add more useful bots to the Discord. <br>
                - I want to form a Constitutional Monarchy, regardless of who my Party chooses as the candidate for our support. <br> <br>
                I have done good work in the past for our nation, and will continue to do so if given the opportunity. All it takes is your vote for me." <br>

            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <b>2. Xesphor</b><br>
                Xesphor is the 2nd candidate on the list. He has been a citizen of Medoles for over a year and a contributor to the mapping community and development of the regions of Medoles. Xesphor will be represented under the banner of the Innovation Party of Medoles (IPM) in this election and will launch his first campaign saying: "I am here to make Medoles the best-mapped micronation. I also want to use my experience to help make our democracy stronger and more stable."
                <br><br>
                <b>3. Mymy</b><br>
                The last to join the race for Senator is Mymy, also known as the "finnioniw." They were a former member of the AMM due to conflict of interest and wishes to impose an absolute monarchy. They discussed their campaign saying:

            </p>
            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="padding-left: 50px;">
                "Dear people of Medoles,<br><br>

                We have been betrayed by the AMM, with their liberal ideals and beliefs. I call for the people, to come together and vote on me so we can establish an absolute monarchy! Long live the rightful and only Serene Kingdom!"
            <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="fs-5">
                With the three candidates out of the way, let's see who will come out on top.
